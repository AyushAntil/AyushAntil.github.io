### CPSC 120

* Lab 10 – ayush-and-jaylen

Lab 10 was one of my favorites because it was the first time I felt confident working with files and vectors to process real data. I liked how the lab connected programming to meaningful tasks such as calculating population density or analyzing state information. I learned how to safely read from files, store values in vectors, and use loops to extract useful results from large data sets. This lab helped me understand how C++ can be used in real-world applications, not just small exercises.

* Lab 11 – ayush-and-aaron

Lab 11 stood out to me because it brought together everything we learned about loops, functions, conditionals, and input validation in one project. I liked the challenge of organizing multiple functions to keep the code clean and understandable. This lab taught me how to validate user input properly, return values correctly, and structure my program so each function had one clear purpose. It strengthened my confidence in building programs that feel “complete” and user-friendly.

* Lab 09 – alan-and-ayush

Lab 09 was a favorite because it required thoughtful teamwork and problem-solving, especially when working with more detailed logic in C++. I liked how the lab introduced debugging techniques that helped us fix errors efficiently instead of guessing. I learned how to trace program behavior, test edge cases, and think more critically about how each line of code affects the output. This lab helped me improve both my programming accuracy and my ability to communicate clearly with a partner while coding.
